ABSTRACT
Accurate and quantitative distribution patterns and dynamic information on rural residents are important for understanding the generation, recycling, and transportation of domestic waste in rural areas. The range of variation in the distribution of urban and rural residents is usually small and tends to be stable. Therefore, we developed a practical model of rural domestic waste collection and routing based on very high-resolution remote sensing and geographic information system technology to help better manage rural waste collection and transportation. Specifically, the Dilated LinkNet model was used to obtain the building, road, water body, and farmland recognition information on a very high-resolution remote sensing image. A new multiple K-means clustering algorithm was designed to divide building groups. In each group, a series of spatial analyses of buildings, roads, water bodies, and farmlands made it easier to select environmentally aware waste collection sites (WCSs). The active-learning Pointer Network was used to conduct a traveling salesman analysis on the selected WCSs to obtain the optimal collection route. Finally, in a typical rural study area of China, Huangtu Town, our model achieved a high recognition accuracy, with Intersection over Union accuracies of 0.902 for buildings, 0.906 for roads, 0.933 for water bodies, and 0.891 for farmlands. The total waste collection route was shortened by 7.57% compared with the standard optimization method in the rural scenario. This study established a rural domestic waste collection model that relies solely on information from remote-sensing images. This model provides an effective tool for well-managed rural waste collection and offers planners and managers valuable insights into rural and township waste disposal management.

	Introduction
With the development of society and economy, as well as the gradual modification of lifestyles and consumption patterns of villagers in rural areas of China, the generation of domestic waste in villages and towns is increasing (Han et al., 2019). According to statistics, the national rural residential waste generation rate is roughly 0.52 kg·d-1 person-1(Han et al., 2018). In response to increasing waste production, villages and towns invest more in environmental sanitation yearly. In China’s established towns, sanitation special vehicle equipment has increased from 115,000 units in 2015 to 120,000 units in 2020, while sanitation special vehicle equipment in townships increased from 24,100 units in 2015 to 28,600 units in 2020 (Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People’s Republic of China, 2021). However, due to a lack of management and techniques supporting rural areas of China, the collection and treatment of domestic wastes are still insufficient, and a substantial volume of domestic waste remains to be heaped up in the open fields or dumped into rivers at will. In 2019, around 80% of administrative towns nationwide had effective treatment of residential waste. The harmless treatment rate of rural domestic waste is only 38.27% (Department of Rural Surveys, National Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China, 2020), which is much lower than the 99.2% in the cities and 96.2% percent in the counties (Tan et al., 2020). Therefore, establishing a practical and reliable disposal system for rural residential waste is critical.
Waste collection is a key part of the waste management system, and the costs incurred in this segment account for a large portion of the total waste disposal system costs (Abdallah et al., 2019). Inefficient collection and transportation routes can significantly increase collection costs. Furthermore, the collection and transportation of waste produce foul-smelling gases comprising sulfide, ammonia, ketone aldehydes, and other compounds, which may pose a health risk to individuals traveling along the route(Kurian Joseph et al., 2012) and cause environmental stress in ecologically sensitive rural areas. Developed countries (such as Europe, the United States, and Japan) have a high level of urban-rural integration, and work on rural waste collection systems has started earlier. The existing rural infrastructure is nearly ideal, and the concepts and technologies of waste collection and transportation systems are mature. Chang et al. (1981) developed a linear model based on the concept of efficiency to solve the complex problem of the link between Waste Collection Sites (WCSs), disposal sites, and collection routes. Jia et al. (2022) used a mixed-integer linear programming technique for landfill siting, making it a hot research topic in the wastecollection and transportation industry. Hannan et al. (2020) added a comprehensive consideration of the impact of environmental factors on on-site selection, such as atmospheric pollution, leachate, and noise pollution, to the original economized siting model for waste management collection and transportation systems, overcoming the problem of the model considering only economic benefits.
The primary objectives of waste collection route optimization include reducing route length (Ağaçsapan & Çabuk, 2020), time (Son & Louati, 2016), and cost (Malakahmad et al., 2014). Research on waste-collection routes and their solution algorithms has emerged along with many site selection strategies. Instead of following a predetermined fixed route, an algorithm is required to optimize the waste collection route to gather waste (Islam & Rahman, 2012) efficiently. These optimized routes can reduce travel distances and vehicle counts, lowering labor expenses, fuel costs, operating time, and greenhouse gas emissions (Abdelli et al., 2016; Vu et al., 2018). This routing process is comparable to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), a classic NP puzzle (Vu et al., 2019). The TSP solutions can be divided into two categories. The first type is a mathematical optimization method. There are numerous heuristics-based algorithms, such as dynamic programming(S. Wang et al., 2018), ant colony algorithm(Wei et al., 2019), simulated annealing(Zhou et al., 2019), LKH algorithm(Helsgaun, 2009), and Concorde solver(Bonomo et al., 2012) et al. The second type is deep reinforcement learning methods (Zhang et al., 2020). Researchers have frequently combined the characteristics of local waste collection to develop a series of standard algorithms after adjusting and optimizing earlier studies, and effective and stable solution algorithms can be derived by testing different algorithms (Akhtar et al., 2017; Hannan et al., 2020). 
Geographic information systems (GIS) have become increasingly popular in solid waste collection systems in recent years(Singh, 2019). Dehghani et al. (2018) used a GIS environment to construct an optimization model to efficiently operate a solid waste collection system from three perspectives: storage, collection, and transfer. Abdallah et al. (2019) compared a GIS-based Smart Collection System (SCS) with traditional approaches in terms of time, pollution, and cost proposed an integrated SCS design, and investigated the major aspects of the smart system. Rızvanoğlu et al. (2020) used the linear programming model and the ArcMap network analysis module to solve the solid waste collection and transportation through route optimization. Meanwhile, researchers can reliably extract information about buildings (Xia et al., 2021), roads (Xu et al., 2018), and water bodies (Song et al., 2020) from high-resolution remote sensing images owing to the advancement of intelligent technologies such as deep learning. This information on land surface elements is linked to residential waste management systems. For example, building characteristics can be utilized to estimate residential production rates and optimize waste collection site distribution, and road network data can be used to identify waste-collection and transportation routes. This is a new method to collect timely spatial information regarding residential waste collection in rural areas.
Because the ecological and habitat environments in rural areas differ from those in urban areas with low economic levels, dispersed populations, narrow roadways, and complicated land types, attempting to replicate urban residential waste management methods will result in issues such as wasteful expenditure (F. Wang et al., 2018). Therefore, the motivation of this study was to design a system appropriate for domestic waste collection and transportation in rural areas by combining intelligent remote-sensing technology, WCS selection, and route optimization technology. In the methodological model proposed in this paper, we examined the possibility of intelligent methods such as semantic segmentation of remote sensing images and active learning neural network to optimize rural domestic waste management systems. The objective of this study was to design a sustainable and modernized rural domestic waste management system using Very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images as the primary data source, including basic data acquisition, WCS selection, and collection route optimization.
2. Study area and data source
2.1. Study area
The study area is Huangtu Town (31°31ʹ–31°40ʹN, 104°26ʹ–104°33ʹE) in Sichuan Province, Southwest China, which covers an area of 84.54 km2 and has a population of approximately 37017 residents (Department of Rural Surveys, National Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China, 2020). Huangtu's geography is separated by hills and dam regions, and its boundary covers two watersheds of the Anchang and Caoxi Rivers (Fig. 1), with a subtropical humid monsoon climate. We selected Huangtu as our study area for two reasons. First, Huangtu represents many other Chinese rural towns with a diverse geographical environment and low population density. From 2011 to 2019, the population density of the town remained at approximately 500 people/km2 (Department of Rural Surveys, National Bureau of Statistics of the People’s Republic of China, 2020). Such a typical and complicated characteristic offers a valuable opportunity to assess our decentralized waste collection and routing model and strategy. Second, our previous studies on Huangtu have provided useful information for the optimization of this study, which can be used to add environmental constraints to the model framework.
2.2. VHR remote sensing data
One aim of this study is to obtain foundational information on rural domestic waste collection directly from remote sensing images. The primary research data of this study are VHR remote sensing images acquired from screenshots of Google Earth in 2020. The VHR images had three optical bands (green, red, and blue) at level 18. After the applied data processing, including image mosaic, clipping, and bit depth adjustment, the study area images were re-projected into UTM projection and resampled to a 1 m spatial resolution (Fig. 1). 
Based on the VHR images, 30 sample patches with a size of 1000 × 1000 pixels were selected as the training data for rural environmental information recognition (purple square in Fig. 1). These patches contain as many typical building, road, waterbody, and farmland types in Huangtu, ensuring that the sample data meets the requirements of the deep learning model for the diversity of features. To acquire the actual label of the ground truth data, we used a precise visual interpretation to draw the outlines of the rooftops, road boundaries, waterbody boundaries, and farmland boundaries in the VHR images of the sample patches. There are five land-cover classes in the labeled sample patches: building, road, water body, farmland, and background (Fig. 2).
2.3. Auxiliary data
In addition to VHR images, we used various auxiliary data in this study. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from Aster GDEM were downloaded from the Google Earth Engine platform to facilitate environmental analysis. As a reference, the vector data of roads were obtained from Open Street Maps (OSM). Vector data for administrative township boundary were acquired from the National Geomatics Center of China.
3. Method
3.1. Framework of the rural waste decentralized collection system
The research methodology of this study was based on three major stages of the waste collection system. First, information recognition on VHR satellite images, as well as a semantic segmentation model, is used to obtain the foundational environmental elements, such as buildings, roads, water bodies, and farmlands, cost-effectively. Second, the volume and frequency of waste generation were estimated based on the spatial characteristics of buildings, and a series of spatial analyses of buildings, roads, water bodies, and farmlands were used to determine where WCSs should be located in an environmentally aware way. Third, to improve the flexibility and efficiency of collection and transportation between WCSs, we introduced a reinforcement learning-based routing strategy using the Pointer Network (Ptr-Net) (Vinyals et al., 2017). The rural domestic waste collection model is illustrated in Fig. 3. The integration of state-of-the-art image recognition, GIS spatial analysis, and reinforcement learning technologies allows the establishment of the entire collection process.
3.2. VHR image recognition 
Based on the capability of learning high-level features from an image, we adopted a deep learning method and applied it to acquiring foundational environmental data. On VHR images, buildings, roads, water bodies, and farmlands in rural areas are spatially dispersed and have a disproportionate amount compared to the background. Hence, it is crucial to maintain precise spatial information in the recognition model. In addition, rural roads are frequently narrow and complex, with natural connections and high-span features, which must be accounted for in the model. In this study, we chose Dialated LinkNet (D-LinkNet) as the recognition model because it can effectively deal with these issues by including dilated convolutional layers to enhance the receptive field of feature points (Zhou et al., 2018).
3.2.1. D-LinkNet
D-LinkNet is based on LinkNet (Chaurasia & Culurciello, 2017) and adds dilated convolution layers to its core for road-extraction tasks (L. Zhou et al., 2018). Dilated convolution enlarges the receptive fields of convolutional kernels by merely calculating the linear combination of the parameters of a kernel and a limited number of pixels in its range. Therefore, dilated convolution is commonly used to replace traditional pooling techniques,, without decreasing the resolution of the feature map. The introduced dilated block consisted of four dilated convolution processes with different dilations. After adding the dilated block between the encoder and decoder. Fig. 4 shows the overall design of the D-LinkNet, the implementation of dilated convolution is lauded for its simplicity.
In the implementation, we combine binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and Dice loss for each class to create a multiclass loss. The BCE loss for each sample is defined as follows:
Lossbce=-yi×logyj-1-yi×log1-yj #1
The Dice coefficient is a set similarity measure function commonly used to calculate the similarity between two samples, and the value range is [0, 1]. The Dice loss formula is shown in Eq.2:
Lossdice=1-2×y∩yy+y #2
\hat{y}\capy is the intersection between \hat{y} and y. \hat{y} and y. sub tables represent the number of elements of \hat{y} and y, where the molecular coefficient is 2. The total loss can be calculated following Eq.3 to represent:
Loss= Lossbce+Lossdice #3
3.2.2. Network training and prediction
All semantic segmentation network models were implemented using the PyTorch framework (Paszke et al., 2017). D-LinkNet and all comparative experiments were trained on an Nvidia GTX 3060 graphics card with 12 G memory. The weights of the ResNet34 model pretrained using ImageNet were used to initialize the D-LinkNet. The following hyperparameters were constrained: the batch size was four for the Huangtu dataset, and the initial learning rate of D-LinkNet was 2\times{10}^{-4}; and the rate was updated every quarter of an epoch. The D-LinkNet was used to train 400 epochs on the Huangtu dataset after entering the network. We applied a data augmentation strategy that included random cropping, rotation, translation, and horizontal flipping operations to enlarge the dataset and reduce the overfitting caused by insufficient data.
3.3. WCSs Locating 
Based on the recognition results of the VHR images, the volume of waste generation should generally be positively proportional to the density of the building distribution. For example, we may determine where there is a high frequency or clustering of waste generation, which is a key factor in determining where WCSs should be located. Therefore, this study utilized GIS spatial analysis to establish the distribution of WCSs. First, areas with varying building clustering densities corresponding to their waste generation levels were categorized. Second, different parameters are analyzed within each hot-cold area to cluster building points into reasonable waste collection regions. Third, the location of the WCS corresponding to each waste collection region was set according to a series of environmental constraints.
3.3.1. Hot spot area analysis of building points
Using the Getis-Ord Gi* (GOG) statistic (Ord & Getis, 1995), we constructed a map showing statistically significant hot-cold areas of waste generation based on the weighted building points. The outcome is a regionally grouped representation of waste generation level, with either high or low values. In addition, an Optimized Hot Spot Analysis (OHSA) (Esri, 2022) can employ parameters derived from the characteristics of the input building points to run the GOG method, resulting in optimal results. The workflow for OHSA can be calculated as follows:
Step 1: Count the number of unique location features (UL).
Step 2: Calculate the average and median distances from each unique building point to its nearest neighbors. The average nearest neighbor distance (ANN) was derived by averaging the distances of the nearest neighbor of each feature and dividing them by the number of features (N). The median nearest neighbor distance (MNN) is calculated by sorting the closest neighbor distances from the least to the greatest and choosing the distance in the middle of the list.
Step 3: Initialize the snap distance (SD) to the smaller values of the ANN and MNN. The SD was adjusted as follows to allow for coincident points:
Scalar=ULN #4
where N is the number of features in the input-feature layer. The product of the scalar multiplied by SD is the adjusted snap distance.
Step 4: Integrate the incident points in three iterations: first, with the adjusted SD times 0.10, then 0.25, and finally, with an SD equal to the completely adjusted SD.
 If the aggregation procedure yields enough weighted points, OHSA is completed properly. These output hotspots indicate where additional WCSs should be established to collect waste effectively.
3.3.2. Multiple points clustering algorithm
To cluster the building points of different rural environments (results of Section 3.2.1), we propose a multiple K-means clustering algorithm (MKCA) to specify varying parameters in different hot/cold spot areas for the point clustering process.
K-means is a quick clustering method that requires a user to set the number of clusters in advance (Kanungo et al., 2002). The steps of the K-means algorithm are as follows:
Step 1: Choose the number of clusters, k.
Step 2: Create k clusters randomly and find the cluster centers, or create k random locations and use them as cluster centers.
Step 3: Assign each point to the cluster center that is closest to it.
Step 4: Calculate the new cluster centers again.
Step 5: Repeat the previous two steps until a convergence requirement (typically, the assignment has not changed) is achieved.
The main idea of MKCA is to group points within a predefined  Service Radius (SR) of the WCS into a cluster class by repeatedly calling K-means based on the distance between the points in the previous clustering result. MKCA calculates the maximum distance (MD) between every point in each cluster class, using the previous clustering classes as inputs. The important operation is comparing MD and SR; if MD is less than SR, the cluster is assigned as a completed cluster and excluded from subsequent computations. Otherwise, we repeated K-means clustering on this cluster. The criteria for setting the number of clusters are calculated as follows:
NC= SRMD #5
MKCA is repeated iteratively until all clusters satisfy the maximum serving-distance requirements. In addition, a hierarchical relationship is generated between each cluster. The idea and implementation of MKCA are shown in Fig. 5.
3.3.3. Environmental Constraint of Waste Collection Site Selection
Using GIS technology, we developed a procedure for locating a WCS for each clustered area. GIS spatial analyses such as buffer analysis, reclassification, and overlay analysis were performed, and a thematic map was created for site selection. 
According to the applicable laws and regulations, we excluded areas where the topography was unsuitable for WCSs, such as elevation, slope, and other geographical constraints, as well as ecological red-line protection areas. To locate environmentally favorable sites in rural areas, we designed housing, water body, and farmland factors as environmental variables, and road factor for waste collection and transportation.
First, according to the principle of environmental friendliness, the WCS should be maintained at a specific protection distance from water bodies (DFW), farmlands (DFF), and building points (DFB). Second, according to the principle of convenient transportation, the WCS should be located within a distance from the main road (denoted as DTR) and where the trash truck can arrive. Third, given that residents' willingness to throw waste is influenced to some extent by their throwing distance, we assume that the allocated WCS will not exceed the MD from the building cluster (DTH). Based on these distances, we established the corresponding buffer zones and calculated the suitable location region of the WCS as follows:
Rwcs=BRw ∩BRf ∩BRb∩BRroad #6
Where {BR}_w and {BR}_f represent the buffers created at DFW and DFF from water bodies and farmlands, respectively. \overline{{BR}_w} and \overline{{BR}_f} were the results of removing {BR}_w and {BR}_f from the study area, respectively. {BR}_b is the symmetrical difference region of the building points buffer created by DTH and the buffer created from DFB.\ {BF}_{road} is a road buffer created based on the DTR. R_{wcs} is the result of spatial intersection analysis of \overline{{BR}_w}, {BR}_b and {BR}_{road}.
Within the R_{wcs}, we can determine the exact position of the WCSs according to real conditions, such as planning and management policies. In this study, to facilitate the establishment of network relationships for subsequent transport routing analysis, we randomly selected a point on the road included in R_{wcs} as the location of the WCS for each building cluster.
3.4. Waste collection routing by using Ptr-Net
Once the WCSs are set up, a conventional waste collection system can be established based on a predetermined schedule, in which the frequency of waste collection routes is independent of the waste level in bins. Typical waste collection routing models include WCSs (sources), waste treatment sites (destinations), and trucks(Bányai et al., 2019). The overall goal of the collection route design of waste trucks is to raise environmental consciousness by minimizing the distance between possible routes that visit each WCS once and return to the treatment site. This routing problem represents the standard TSP (Bonomo et al., 2012). To establish a link between artificial neural and combinatorial optimization issues, we focused on the Ptr-Net in this study, which allows us to solve the problem of mapping one sequence to another sequence, with the output sequence's content being identical to that of the input sequence, but the order of the sequence has changed. For the TSP, given a list of WCSs, Ptr-Net can determine the best visit order based on the shortest distance.  
Based on the sequence-to-sequence model (Luong et al., 2016), Ptr-Net comprises an encoder and decoder, two separate recurrent neural networks. The encoder converts the input sequence into an intermediate vector that is used as the input for the decoder. The decoder employs an attention mechanism in each step to select the element with the highest weight and generates a reordered sequence. The attention mechanism is described as follows:
uji=vTtanhW1ej+W2di    j∈1,…,n #7
pCi | C1,…,Ci-1,Q=softmaxui #8
where e_j is the output of the encoder’s hidden layer at step j and e_j is the hidden layer of the output order at step i. v, W_1, and W_2 are the parameters to be learned in the Ptr-Net. p is the output probability vector, using u^i as the input. The decoder determines the output order according to p.
In the training phase, reinforcement learning does not require labeling of training data and can learn on its own. In this study, we used the policy gradient as follows:
Jθ|Q=ECQ~pθ.|QrewardCQ|Q #9
Q is the set of geographic coordinates for the WCSs, which serves as the input to the problem. While C^Q is the waste-collecting route, which represents the output of the problem. The reward value represents the total cost of one collection route when a given Q, is used as the optimization objective. The mathematical expectation of the reward is denoted by J, which can be optimized using the following equation:
∇θJθ|Q= ECQ~pθ.|QrewardC|Q-bQ∇θlogpθC|Q #10
The reward value is the length of a real route and b\left(Q\right) is a baseline function that minimizes the total square error of the gradient by estimating the reward value. This TSP solver optimizes two types of Ptr-Net: actor and critic models. Given Q as the input, the critic model predicts the expected route length, generally called the state value (b\left(Q\right)). As the expected route length matches the actual length computed from the route predicted by the actor model, the parameters of the critic model are optimized. The actor model updates its policy parameters with a value called advantage, which is the square error of the state-value and actual reward value. Thus, the performance of the Ptr-Net was improved by improving the accuracy of the critic network.
Once the network has been trained, we input the sites that are currently required to collect waste to obtain an optimized collection path.
4. Results
4.1. Results of VHR image recognition
To assess the performance of the VHR image segmentation method, we utilized the Intersection over Union (IoU) and the F1 score. IoU represents the overlap ratio between the predicted patches and ground truth patches of the entire image, which is defined as
IoU= A∩BA ∪B#11
A represents the predicted patch, B represents the corresponding ground truth patch, and a higher IoU suggests more accurate prediction results. In addition, Polygon IoU can also represent an edge's completeness. The F1 score is an indicator of the accuracy of the two-category model. The precision and recall must be calculated to obtain the F1 score. The result of recognition can be categorized as true positive (TP), which indicates the number of positive class pixels that are correctly predicted (IoU > 50%), and false positive (FP), which indicates the number of negative pixels that are incorrectly predicted as the positive class. A false negative (FN) indicates the number of pixels incorrectly predicted as the negative class. Precision and recall are defined as follows:
Precision= TPTP+FP#12
Recall= TP(TP+FN)#13
  According to these authors, the F1 score is the harmonic mean value of the precision and recall rates, implying that the precision and recall rates are equally relevant, which is defined as:
F1 score=2×Precison×RecallPrecison+Recall #14
To further demonstrate the accuracy of our methods, we used two frequent-use models, U-Net(Ronneberger et al., 2015) and DeepNet V3+(Hackel et al., 2017), to compare with our model in the environmental element recognition experiment.
0 summarizes the results of the semantic segmentation models for the recognition dataset. For building recognition, U-Net and DeepNet V3+ achieved polygon IoU values of 0.839 and 0.882, respectively. D-LinkNet had the best polygon IoU performance of 0.902, which was greater than all other models and even 4.36 percent higher than that of U-Net, and 错误!未找到引用源。 shows their performance. In densely built areas, the D-LinkNet model could extract independent building objects with small sizes, whereas the prediction results of the other two models were more continuous, and there was some leakage for smaller structures. The D-LinkNet model yielded more precise recognition results in areas where buildings were dispersed, with fewer false and missing extractions. In road and waterbody recognition, D-LinkNet also achieved the best performance of 0.926 and 0.933, respectively, for the polygon IoU, which surpassed the accuracy of U-Net and DeepNet V3+. In the remote sensing images, the extraction results of the D-LinkNet model were closer to the boundaries of roads and water bodies, and the object shapes were more complete ((Fig.7(a) and (b)). This enables us to obtain more continuous recognition results, which are crucial for constructing road networks (Fig.7(a)). For farmland recognition, the D-LinkNet and DeepNet V3+ models could accurately identify continuous farmland boundaries, with IoUs of 0.891 and 0.877, respectively. Moreover, the DN model was more capable of distinguishing more detailed boundaries inside large farmlands, as shown in the red boxes in Fig.8(c).
In summary, we conducted comparative experiments with other frequent-use models on rural buildings, roads, water bodies, and farmland recognition tasks to verify that our methods produced high-quality results. All evaluation metrics indicated that our model accurately extracted all rural environmental elements. In terms of visual effects, our model minimizes the background influence and produces extraction results with complete morphology and continuous boundaries. This improves our capability to vectorize the results to capture crucial characteristics for establishing a rural waste collection system, such as building size and road length. 
4.2. Result of WCSs locating
Building polygons were created, and the area of each polygon was calculated by vectorizing the VHR recognition result. The center point of each polygon was then acquired as a point form of the buildings, and its area was recorded as a field. A total of 11424 building points were obtained from Huangtu Town. When expressing the distribution of the population of Huangtu by building points, we utilized the polygon area size as the standard and presented it as varied point sizes (错误!未找到引用源。).
  In hotspot analysis, the area corresponding to the building point was employed as the analysis field, and the queen neighborhood was utilized to generate a distance weight matrix. It is necessary to store two calculation results: the G value normalized to the Z-score and the p-value. At the significance level of 0.05, a positive Z-score and p-value less than 0.05 suggest a cluster of hot spots and a negative Z-score, whereas a negative Z-score and p-value less than 0.05 indicate a cluster of cold spots and p-values greater than 0.05, indicating insignificant results. In the context of building spatial statistics, we identify hot spots, non-significant results, and cold spots as high-clustering, medium-clustering, and scattered areas, respectively. Fig.8 depicts those three areas in the form of fishnets.
In the high-clustering, medium-clustering, and scattered areas, the required SR parameters for MKCA were set to 100, 200, and 400 m, respectively, in this study (Table 2). This setting implies that a smaller clustering area is required in the high-clustering areas than in the scattered areas because the average waste generation in the high-clustering areas is larger. Fig.9 shows the results of MKCA clustering for the three areas. In Huangtu Town, we formed 20, 10, and 15 clusters for the three regions for a total of 45 clusters.
Within each cluster, we adjusted the distance parameters of DFB, DFW, DFF, DTR, and DTH according to Table 2, in accordance with the predetermined environmental limitations, to produce four buffer zones. According to Eq(6), the areas meeting the intersection of building buffers, road buffers, outside waterbody buffers, and outside farmland buffers are where WCSs can be established in an environmentally responsible manner. Note that the aim of this study was to build a comprehensive process framework, and factors such as engineering conditions for WCS settings were not examined in this study. Instead, we randomly selected a point on the road included in the intersection to serve as a WCS for each cluster. Fig. 10 depicts the full procedure for establishing the WCSs in Huangtu Town. Accordingly, 45 WCSs (with the same number as building clusters) were created.
4.3. Results of waste collection routing
In this study, the average waste output at the WCS was set to 400 kg. Thus, each standard waste truck with a loading capacity of 5 ton can be collected and transported from 12 sites. Therefore, we trained a Ptr-Net model to solve the 12-points TSP optimization. First, we randomly selected 12 training points from all the WCSs and saved the distance between adjacent points in an adjacency matrix. Second, the matrix is fed into Ptr-Net for model training, as explained in Section 3.3. In the actual training of this study, the batch size was set to 512, the study ratio to 1e-4, and the number of epochs to 10000. Finally, the WCSs and road polylines are read into the model, and the model outputs an array of sorted points ,which is the optimal collection route.

As a baseline, we employed the schedule of visiting each point clockwise from the starting point as a conventional optimized route reference. As shown in Fig.11, Ptr-Net calculated the s1-s13-s14-s15-s7-s6-s5-s4-s8-s2-s3-s9-s10-s11-s12 sequence as the optimal collection route for the high-clustering area dataset, where the total length of the route was 24.911 km. On the mixed area dataset, Ptr-Net calculated the optimal collection route as s11-s10-s9-s8-s6-s5-s4-s7-s12-s13-s14-s3-s1-s15-s2 with an optimal length of 27.848 km. Likewise, Ptr-Net optimized the route of s13-s1-s15-s14-s12-s10-s9-s4-s3-s5-s6-s8-s7-s11-s2 to 42.651 km on the scattered area dataset. This means that the length of the optimized route by Ptr-Net decreased by an average of 3.711 km compared to that with conventional routing optimization. In the high-clustering area dataset, the length of the Ptr-Net route was not significantly different from that of the reference route because the high-clustering area corresponds to a town area with a dense road network, and it is easier to discover the shortest distance between two sites. On the mixed and scattered area datasets, the results of Ptr-Net were reduced by 5.73% and 9.40%, respectively, relative to the reference routes. This result indicates that the performance of the Ptr-Net is more prominent in large-scale rural scenarios with sparse sites and incomplete road networks, which is consistent with the objectives of this study. Based on an identical environment in Section 3.2.2, the average time spent after ten predictions by the Ptr-Net for route optimization was 2.89s, 2.96s, and 2.93s on the three datasets, respectively (错误!未找到引用源。).. It can be observed that the relatively quick optimization time is compatible with the great efficiency of this model in real-world scenarios.
To summarize, the proposed route optimization model based on Ptr-Net decreased the length of transportation routes, the energy consumption of waste-collection trucks, and greenhouse gas emissions. This enables the investigation of the impact of scheduling and assignment on economic and ecological factors where the collection procedure causes emissions.
	Discussion
5.1. Application potential of remote sensing recognition technology in rural waste disposal analysis
Within the framework of this research, we used a VHR image dataset and deep learning-based recognition technology, allowing for a comprehensive investigation of the waste collection system in a typical rural town in China. More generally, this study focused on extracting crucial information from VHR images to facilitate the design and analysis of waste management systems in rural areas, including buildings as waste sources, roads as networks for waste transportation, and water bodies and farmlands as environmental constraints. The growing significance of remote sensing recognition technology in rural waste management has two aspects. First, there is a relative lack of basic spatial information on the environment in rural areas. Owing to the complexity and expense of data collection, map data in rural regions are less accurate than those in metropolitan regions in China. As shown in Fig.12(c) and (d), most rural regions on the online map of Huangtu Town lack the fundamental environmental data required to construct a waste management system. These more specific spatial data enable the implementation of decentralized waste treatment and permit a more scientific and reasonable approach to the design and operation of waste management systems in rural regions. Second, intelligent analysis of VHR images enhances the cognitive capacity of environmental elements. In addition to the building, road, waterbody, and farmland elements applied in this study (Fig. 11(b)), the deep learning-based image semantic segmentation model can accurately extract environmental elements from rural VHR images, including forest land and garden land. Integrating these environmentally sensitive spatial data and specific local environmental policies into our proposed framework can assist government managers in conducting a comprehensive review of the locations of WCSs, thus yielding practical implications. On the other hand, the technological upgrading of the deep learning model itself, such as introducing a learning model based on the attention mechanism and our focused enhancements, will further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of VHR image recognition.
5.2. Limitations of this framework
There are also limitations of the study and the described framework that point to directions for further research. Our framework focuses on the realization of the entire technical process, as few previous studies have aimed to construct environmental awareness of rural waste management systems from the standpoint of VHR remote sensing solutions. Our study considers a series of WCSs because the characteristics of buildings make it possible to estimate the volume of waste in each region. However, a complete waste management system should include other sites, such as waste treatment sites and truck depots. The next hierarchy level should consist of waste bins and other equipment. In addition to the site location, other parameters, such as the number and size of sites, must be completely determined according to the real optimization objective. For example, an effective service network study was conducted in the Nanjing Jiangbei New area (Liang & Liu, 2018). These features can be incorporated into a framework for future research. 
Moreover, intelligent collection based on e-waste management technology plays an important role in China (Chung et al., 2011). New industry 4.0 technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, cause waste management to transform into a dynamic cyber-physical system(Bányai et al., 2019). In the case of the dynamic scenario, real-time information on the loading level of bins, the truck-transport volume, and the available processing capacity are synchronized in the waste management cloud, which has a significant impact on the global processes of the waste management system and should be considered in our future research.
	Conclusions
An practical rural waste collection model is of great significance in the context of the current increasing demand for decentralized waste collection and routing in China. This study combined remote sensing, GIS technology, and neural networks to explore the application of a better model for rural waste collection scenario.
In this framework, we introduced the D-LinkNet model to extract rural buildings, roads, water bodies, and farmlands, on the VHR remote sensing image. After a series of data processing steps, such as vectorization and element conversion, the foundational environment-element dataset was builded. Based on them, we creatively designed the MKCA to divide building points into different waste-colletion groups. Within each group, we developed a GIS analysis-based procedure for locating a WCS according to theenvironmental constrains. Subsequently, we introduce and train a Ptr-Net to solve the TSP problem of the optimal route for waste collection.The results of Huangtu Town show that our model has strong practicability. Specifically, it can be listed as follows: (1) Compared with U-Net and DeepNetV3+, D-LinkNet performs better in terms of segmentation accuracy in rural scenario, with an average IoU of 0.913 and an average F1Score of 0.94; (2) The MKCA algorithm is more convenient and targeted for grouping building points with different SR parameters; (3) Ptr-Net has a significantly shorter total route and more prominent performance in large-scale scenarios with sparse sites and incomplete road networks. The main conclusions drawn are as follows. In the rural waste collection task, our proposed model has good practicability, performance in extracting environmental elements, easier locating WCS, and shorter collection routes. This will greatly reduce the labor, time, and funds consumed by the government and the community on waste collection and has great potential for practical application.
In follow-up research, combined with the development of web GIS systems, adding modules such as WCS capacity monitoring and automatic personnel allocation will help the model be better applied. The mature system will also have more use value and commercial value.
